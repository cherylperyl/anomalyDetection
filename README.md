# Hello there!

This is my very first Machine Learning project.

The aim was to come up with an ensemble of models to predict if a bid was made by a bot or human. [Bids made by bots on the auction platform were undesirable :( ]

Along with another teammate, I perfomed 
01 Exploratory data analysis and
02 - 03 Feature engineering on the time series data. Then we used the data to 
04 train our ensemble of models. We then 
05 selected the best ensemble

Models explored were:
- Random forest
- XGBoost
- Catboost

Dataset was obtained from kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot


** currently unable to upload 01 and 02 of the project as the file size is too large :(
